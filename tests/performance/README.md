## üîß Configuration

### Performance Budgets

Budgets can be customized in `scripts/performance-benchmark.js`:

```javascript
const BENCHMARK_CONFIG = {
  budgets: {
    testExecution: 300000,    // 5 minutes max
    memoryUsage: 512 * 1024 * 1024,  // 512MB max
    bundleSize: 500 * 1024,  // 500KB max
    lighthouse: {
      performance: 90,
      accessibility: 95,
      bestPractices: 90,
      seo: 95
    }
  }
};
```

### Test Environment

Tests can be configured for different environments:

- **Development**: Full test suite with detailed reporting
- **CI/CD**: Optimized tests with budget enforcement  
- **Production**: Real User Monitoring simulation
- **Local**: Quick feedback for developers

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Lighthouse Fails**: Ensure dev server is running on port 3000
2. **Memory Tests Unreliable**: Run with `--expose-gc` flag for accurate GC
3. **Bundle Analysis Fails**: Ensure fresh build exists in `dist/`
4. **Flaky Test Results**: Use multiple test runs and statistical analysis

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for detailed performance metrics:

```bash
DEBUG=performance npm run test:performance
```

### Performance Profiling

For detailed profiling:

```bash
# Profile memory usage
node --inspect --expose-gc scripts/performance-benchmark.js

# Profile CPU usage  
npm run test:performance -- --reporter=verbose
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Writing Performance Tests

1. **Establish Baselines**: Always compare against known good performance
2. **Use Statistical Analysis**: Average multiple runs for reliable results
3. **Test Real Scenarios**: Simulate actual user interactions and data loads
4. **Monitor Trends**: Track performance over time, not just point-in-time
5. **Set Realistic Budgets**: Balance performance goals with functionality needs

### Performance Optimization

1. **Content System**: Optimize hook memoization and cache strategies
2. **Bundle Optimization**: Use code splitting and tree shaking effectively  
3. **Component Performance**: Minimize re-renders and optimize animations
4. **Memory Management**: Prevent leaks and optimize garbage collection
5. **Core Web Vitals**: Focus on user-centric performance metrics

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Automated Testing**: Run performance tests in CI/CD pipelines
2. **Performance Budgets**: Enforce strict limits to prevent regressions
3. **Real User Monitoring**: Supplement synthetic tests with real data
4. **Regular Reviews**: Analyze performance reports and trends monthly
5. **Team Education**: Keep team informed about performance best practices
