# Navigation IA Research: Multi-Service Musician Websites

## Research Overview
Analysis of navigation patterns for musicians serving multiple audiences: performers, students, and collaborators.

## Key Findings

### 1. Service Priority Patterns

**Primary Service Forward (Most Common)**
- Lead with highest revenue/core identity service in main navigation
- Example pattern: "Performances" → "Lessons" → "Collaborations"
- User benefit: Clear value proposition hierarchy

**Audience-Based Grouping (Alternative)**  
- Organize by user type rather than service type
- Example: "Book a Performance" | "Learn Music" | "Collaborate"
- User benefit: Direct path for each audience segment

**Hybrid Approach (Professional Sites)**
- Primary service prominent in header/hero
- Secondary services in navigation menu
- Tertiary services in footer or sub-menus

### 2. Navigation Structure Recommendations

**For RrishMusic Recommended Structure:**

```
PRIMARY NAV:
- Performances (primary - highest visibility)
- Teaching (secondary - established content)
- About 
- Contact

SECONDARY/FOOTER:
- Collaborations (tertiary - emerging service)
```

**Rationale:**
- Performance services = highest revenue potential
- Teaching = established content exists, easy secondary conversion
- Collaborations = mentioned but not primary focus yet

### 3. User Guidance Strategy

**Service Differentiation:**
- Clear value propositions for each service
- Distinct call-to-action buttons
- Service-specific contact methods

**Cross-Service Navigation:**
- "Also interested in..." suggestions
- Related services sidebar/footer
- Clear service boundaries to avoid confusion

## Implementation Priority
1. Restructure navigation to lead with Performance services
2. Maintain Teaching as prominent secondary option  
3. Add Collaborations as tertiary service discovery
4. Implement clear service differentiation in content presentation

## Success Metrics
- Reduced bounce rate from primary landing pages
- Increased engagement with performance-related content
- Clear conversion paths for each service type
