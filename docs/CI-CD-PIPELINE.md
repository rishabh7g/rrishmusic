# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the RrishMusic project. The pipeline ensures code quality, runs comprehensive tests, and automates deployment processes.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 🔄 Workflows

#### 1. **Quality Checks & Testing Pipeline** (`quality-checks.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull requests to main, pushes to main, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality assurance and testing

**Jobs**:
- **Quality Gates**: Fast-fail checks for basic quality requirements
- **Unit Tests & Coverage**: Comprehensive test execution with coverage reporting
- **Quality Enforcement**: Enforces coverage thresholds and quality standards
- **Performance Check**: Bundle size analysis and performance validation
- **Security Scan**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Status Check**: Overall pipeline status aggregation

#### 2. **Continuous Integration** (`ci.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull requests to main, pushes to main
**Purpose**: Quick validation and build verification

**Jobs**:
- **Quick Validation**: Detects relevant code changes
- **Test & Build**: Core testing and build verification
- **Notifications**: Success/failure reporting

#### 3. **Deployment** (`deploy.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pushes to main branch
**Purpose**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## Quality Gates

### 🚀 Required Checks

All the following must pass before code can be merged:

1. **TypeScript Compilation** (`npm run type-check`)
   - No TypeScript errors
   - All type definitions resolved

2. **ESLint Quality Check** (`npm run lint`)
   - Code style consistency
   - Best practice enforcement
   - No linting errors

3. **Build Verification** (`npm run build`)
   - Successful production build
   - Bundle analysis and size checks

4. **Unit Tests** (`npm run test`)
   - All tests pass
   - No test failures or timeouts

5. **Coverage Thresholds**
   - **Lines**: 70% minimum
   - **Functions**: 70% minimum
   - **Branches**: 70% minimum
   - **Statements**: 70% minimum

### 📊 Coverage Reporting

- Automatic coverage reports on pull requests
- HTML coverage reports uploaded as artifacts
- Coverage trend tracking
- Per-file threshold enforcement for critical components

## Test Configuration

### 🧪 Test Execution

```bash
# Local development
npm run test              # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage report
npm run test:ui          # UI mode for interactive testing

# CI/CD environment
npm run test -- --run    # Single run without watch
```

### 📋 Coverage Thresholds

| Component Type | Lines | Functions | Branches | Statements |
|---------------|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Global** | 70% | 70% | 70% | 70% |
| **Hooks** | 80% | 80% | 80% | 80% |
| **Form Validation** | 90% | 90% | 90% | 90% |

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Test Execution**: Multi-threaded test runs
- **Smart Caching**: Dependency and build artifact caching
- **Change Detection**: Skip unnecessary runs for doc-only changes
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for flaky tests in CI

## Security & Quality

### 🔒 Security Scanning

- **NPM Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Severity Levels**: Moderate and high vulnerabilities flagged
- **Automated Reports**: Security audit results uploaded as artifacts

### 🎯 Performance Monitoring

- **Bundle Size Analysis**: Tracks JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes
- **Large File Detection**: Warns about bundles >500KB
- **Asset Optimization**: Monitors build output efficiency

## Usage Guide

### 🛠️ For Developers

#### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test && npm run build

# Run specific checks
npm run type-check    # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint         # Code style and quality
npm run test         # Unit tests
npm run build        # Production build
```

#### Before Creating a PR
1. Run all quality gates locally
2. Ensure test coverage meets thresholds
3. Check that build completes successfully
4. Review any security audit warnings

#### Interpreting CI Results
- ✅ **Green checkmarks**: All quality gates passed
- ❌ **Red X marks**: Quality gate failures requiring attention
- ⚠️ **Yellow warnings**: Issues to address but not blocking
- 📊 **Coverage reports**: Available in PR comments and artifacts

### 👥 For Reviewers

#### PR Status Checks
- All required status checks must pass before merge
- Coverage reports show testing completeness
- Security scan results highlight potential vulnerabilities
- Bundle size analysis shows performance impact

#### Quality Indicators
- **Coverage Trend**: Is coverage improving or declining?
- **Test Quality**: Are tests meaningful and comprehensive?
- **Performance Impact**: Any significant bundle size increases?
- **Security**: Any new vulnerabilities introduced?

## Configuration Files

### 📁 Key Files

| File | Purpose | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `vite.config.ts` | Test & build configuration | Vitest setup, coverage thresholds |
| `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml` | Main CI/CD pipeline | Comprehensive quality assurance |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Quick validation | Fast feedback for developers |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Deployment automation | GitHub Pages deployment |
| `src/test/setup.ts` | Test environment setup | Global test configuration |

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Usage | Default |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CI` | Enables CI-specific behavior | `false` |
| `NODE_VERSION` | Node.js version for CI | `20` |
| `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP` | Build sourcemap generation | `false` in production |

## Troubleshooting

### 🐛 Common Issues

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Check failing tests locally
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- src/components/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx

# Debug test with UI
npm run test:ui
```

#### Coverage Threshold Failures
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Check linting issues
npm run lint

# Test production build locally
npm run build
```

#### Security Audit Issues
```bash
# Run security audit locally
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm audit fix

# Check for high-severity issues
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### 🚨 Emergency Procedures

#### Bypassing Checks (USE SPARINGLY)
- Only administrators can merge without status checks
- Emergency fixes require post-merge quality remediation
- Document bypass reasons in merge commit

#### Pipeline Failures
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Run quality gates locally to reproduce issues
3. Address root causes before retrying
4. Contact maintainers for infrastructure issues

## Metrics & Monitoring
