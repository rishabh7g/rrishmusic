- **Branch per Issue:** One branch per GitHub issue for clean tracking
- **PR per Branch:** One pull request per branch with auto-merge enabled

**Workflow Integration:**
1. **Issue Creation** → **Branch Creation** → **Development** → **PR Creation** → **Auto-Merge** → **Branch Cleanup**
2. **Claude.md Workflow:** Follow established 4-phase PR monitoring and cleanup procedures
