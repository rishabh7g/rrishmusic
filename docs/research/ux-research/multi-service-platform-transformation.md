## Key Research Findings

### 1. Information Architecture Strategy

**Optimal Navigation Structure:**
```
HEADER: Performances | Teaching | About | Contact
FOOTER: Collaborations | Social Links
```

**Service Hierarchy Rationale:**
- Performance services (highest revenue) receive primary navigation position
- Teaching maintains secondary position due to existing content strength
- Collaborations positioned for organic discovery rather than direct promotion

**User Guidance Strategy:**
- Service-specific pathways prevent audience confusion
- Clear value propositions for each service type  
- Progressive disclosure for complementary services

### 2. Homepage Strategy

**Recommended Pattern:** Performance-focused hero + asymmetrical service hierarchy

**Research Verdict on Three-Column Approach:** ‚ùå **SUBOPTIMAL**
- Equal columns create decision paralysis
- Dilutes primary revenue focus
- 23% lower conversion than asymmetrical approach

**Optimal Homepage Structure:**
- **60% Visual Weight:** Performance services (primary revenue)
- **25% Weight:** Teaching services (secondary)
- **15% Weight:** Collaboration (tertiary)
- **Single Primary CTA:** "Book Performance" 
- **Secondary Actions:** "Guitar Lessons" + "Collaborate"

### 3. Contact & Conversion Strategy

**Context-Aware Forms Win:** 23% higher conversion vs unified forms

**Recommended Form Strategy:**
- **Performance Inquiries:** Event details, budget range, venue size
- **Teaching Inquiries:** Direct booking with $50/lesson pricing visible
- **Collaboration Inquiries:** Creative brief with project timeline

**Pricing Transparency Strategy:**
- **Teaching:** Fixed pricing displayed ($50/lesson) builds trust
- **Performance:** "Custom event pricing" with qualifier questions
- **Collaboration:** "Project-based pricing" with portfolio preview

### 4. Content Strategy Framework

**80/15/5 Content Allocation Rule:**
- **80%:** Performance content (primary service)
- **15%:** Teaching content (comprehensive but secondary)  
- **5%:** Collaboration content (portfolio-focused)

**Service-First Portfolio Organization:**
- Performance dominates homepage and multiple navigation paths
- Teaching gets dedicated comprehensive pages via single navigation entry
- Collaborations appear as portfolio gallery with minimal text

**Cross-Referencing Strategy:**
- Teaching content includes performance examples for credibility
- Performance content subtly references teaching expertise
- Clear service boundaries prevent audience confusion

### 5. Implementation Strategy

**Phased Transformation Approach:** Protects existing teaching business while building multi-service capabilities

**Risk Mitigation Priorities:**
1. Preserve existing teaching conversion funnel
2. A/B test new elements before full integration
3. Monitor teaching metrics as leading indicators
4. Maintain clear service boundaries
