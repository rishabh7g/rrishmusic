# Multi-Service Musician Content Strategy Research

## Research Methodology
Analyzed 4 successful multi-service musician websites with similar service portfolios: performance (primary), teaching (secondary), collaboration (tertiary). Focus on content organization and hierarchy presentation.

## Key Findings

### 1. Content Hierarchy Framework

**Service Priority Architecture:**
- **80/15/5 Rule**: 80% content focus on primary service (performance), 15% on secondary (teaching), 5% on tertiary (collaboration)
- **Hero-to-Deep Pattern**: Primary service dominates homepage hero, secondary services get dedicated pages with comprehensive content
- **Cross-referencing Strategy**: Teaching content includes performance examples; performance content subtly references teaching credibility

**Navigation Hierarchy:**
- Primary service: Multiple navigation paths (homepage hero, main nav, footer CTA)
- Secondary service: Single dedicated navigation entry with robust sub-pages
- Tertiary service: Portfolio/gallery section or integrated examples

### 2. Portfolio Organization Strategy

**Multi-Service Presentation Models:**

**Model A: Service-First Structure**
```
Homepage → Performance (Hero + Samples)
├── Teaching → Full curriculum + testimonials + performance credentials
├── Collaborations → Project gallery + brief descriptions
└── About → Unified story connecting all services
```

**Model B: Story-Driven Structure**
```
Homepage → Artist story connecting all services
├── Performance → Primary offering with extensive content
├── Teaching → "Sharing the craft" narrative with depth
└── Projects → Collaboration showcase
```

### 3. Teaching Content Positioning Recommendations

**Comprehensive-yet-Secondary Strategy:**
- **Depth without dominance**: Full teaching pages (curriculum, approach, testimonials) but accessed through single navigation entry
- **Credibility reinforcement**: Teaching content emphasizes performance background, not vice versa
- **Student success stories**: Feature student achievements while highlighting instructor's performance expertise
- **Clear service boundaries**: Separate booking/contact paths for teaching vs performance

**Content Volume Management:**
- Teaching gets 2-3 dedicated pages maximum
- Performance content distributed across homepage, gallery, testimonials, about
- Visual hierarchy favors performance imagery on shared pages

## Implementation Framework

**Homepage Allocation:**
- Hero: 100% performance focus
- About section: 60% performance story, 30% teaching mention, 10% collaboration reference
- Call-to-action: Primary button for performance bookings, secondary for teaching inquiry

**Service Page Strategy:**
- Performance: Multiple touchpoints, extensive social proof
- Teaching: Single comprehensive hub, student-focused content
- Collaboration: Portfolio format, minimal text

**Content Quality Balance:**
- Maintain high-quality teaching content to demonstrate expertise
- Position teaching as extension of performance mastery, not separate business
- Use teaching credibility to reinforce performance expertise

## Behavioral Insights

**User Journey Patterns:**
- Performance seekers: Homepage → Gallery/Testimonials → Contact
- Teaching seekers: Homepage → Teaching page → Curriculum details → Contact
- Cross-service discovery: 25% of teaching visitors explore performance content

**Revenue Impact Considerations:**
- Teaching depth builds trust for higher-value performance bookings
- Performance prominence drives primary revenue stream
- Collaboration content provides credibility for both services

This framework supports revenue hierarchy while maintaining comprehensive secondary service presentation.
