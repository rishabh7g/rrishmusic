      "tablet": "sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4", 
      "desktop": "lg:grid-cols-6 xl:grid-cols-8"
    }
  },
  "media": [
    {
      "filename": "performance.jpg",
      "category": "landscape",
      "path": "/images/gallery/performance.jpg",
      "aspectRatio": 1.77,
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```
